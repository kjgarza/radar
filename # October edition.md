## Arc browser

By far the best browser in the market for profesional work. unfortunately The browser company is not looking to update it as it seem. but maybe with the atlassian merge thigns will change. every single feature makes you providinte, aut closing tabs after 12 hrs its great for work aholoic like me. split window is amazing. air traffic is smart with out ai. i could go on.

## ChatGPT Atlas


GPt atlas just cameeo ut an its something i have been watinig for long it follows a similar approach as we have seen in Dia for a few months but being gpt native it takes things furthe the connections with MCP and agnet mode are the most exciting. i can imaginve tasks like flight comparison will become easier, but at the moment is still slow and using context tab in Dia is imo faster and more efficient. 

were this will definetely shine is the access to webapges that have authication now you are able to connects trello with with excel or gmail with no integration needed, i hope atlassian is super upset.

## MCP servers
I am a big fan of standards and MCP is one of those that makes alot of sense. easy to implement everyone is already working on it. this is the equivalent of openapi for the agentic work. 

i have beem creating mcps severs for many of my apis and apis i need to use even in my coplilot local setup i use mcp extensibly.
