Would like to change the main page to use a combination of the dashbaord with sidebard components below:
- npx shadcn@latest add sidebar-12
- npx shadcn@latest add sidebar-05


From the current implementation move the filtering elements to the side bar together with the search. And put the visualisations the blip, and the stats in the main area.
